This is an implementation of the snake game into the [gym style](https://gym.openai.com/docs/).
The goal of this project is to provide an interface for a snake game so that it is easy to train neural networks with little effort.
Therefore I suggest using [Keras](https://keras.io/) with [Keras-rl](https://keras-rl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

To set things up, clone this repository and execute
```sh
pip install -e gym-snake
```
